# OLAFValidation
Sample data and scripts used to create plots in the OLAF validation paper "Comparison of Free Vortex Wake and BEM Results Against Large-Eddy Simulation Results for Highly Flexible Turbines Under Challending Inflow Conditions", published in Wind Energy Science

This repository includes all data for the discretization, wake length, and regularization studies. Both data from the paper and additional output channels are included.

Data for the yaw misalignment azimuthally-averaged plots is also included, along with a plotting script.
